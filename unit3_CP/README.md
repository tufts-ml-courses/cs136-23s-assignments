# Data Analysis Task

In Problem 2, our motivation is to probabilistically model the per-day peak density of birds in the sky as measured by one radar station in the Netherlands. 

This density varies seasonally.

Can we predict 2018's numbers given a training set from 2010 - 2017?


# Outline

Your task in Problem 1 is to implement a RandomWalkSampler and debug it on a simple distribution

Your task in Problem 2 is to apply this RandomWalkSampler to a cool model for bird density as a function of day-of-the-year.
